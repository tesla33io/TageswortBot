# German Language Learning Tool Project

I've been working on a project to assist me in learning German. It consists of two main parts:

## **1. Word Information Extractor:**

I've developed a Python script that gathers information about German words from websites like [DWDS](https://www.dwds.de/) and [verben.de](https://www.verben.de/). This script acts as a personal German tutor, providing useful details about each word, including:

- Grammar: Word type, gender, and plural form.
- Translations: Equivalents in other languages.
- Pronunciation: How to say the word accurately.
- Examples & Explanations: Real-world usage to aid understanding.

The script stores this information in a database for easy access later on.

## **2. Telegram Bot (Currently on Hold):**

Initially, I attempted to create a Telegram bot that would send me a new German word daily. However, after using it for a while, I realized it didn't meet my needs. So, I've decided to pause its development for now.
